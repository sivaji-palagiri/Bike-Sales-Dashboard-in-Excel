# Bike-sale-dashboard-in-excel
I recently worked on a bike sales dataset for Pacific, South America, and Europe regions. The project involved analyzing a dataset containing information about bike owners including their marital status, occupation, age group, and gender.

The goal was to create a dashboard to analyze the bike sales market trends and monitor key indices. I began by cleaning the dataset and then proceeded to read and analyze the data. To create the interactive dashboard, I utilized pivot tables and pivot charts.

In the end, I developed a visually appealing dashboard that provided valuable insights. This report contained valuable information for making informed decisions.

This Dashboard contains valuable insights such as :
- The sales figures based on the average income of customers in a particular region and occupation.
- The overall sales of bikes in Europe, North America, and the Pacific
- The target customers based on their age bracket.
- And the sales based on the customer's commute distance.
